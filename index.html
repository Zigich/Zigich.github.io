                        <h2>Sofia - the social Robot?</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>On October 25, Sophia, a delicate looking woman with doe-brown eyes and  long fluttery eyelashes made international headlines. She'd just become a full citizen of Saudi Arabia -- the first robot in the world to achieve such a status.

                        "I am very honored and proud of this unique distinction. This is historical to be the first robot in the world to be recognized with a citizenship," Sophia said, announcing her new status during the Future Investment Initiative Conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Standing behind a podium as she spoke, to all effects, she presented a humanoid form -- excepting the shimmery metal cap of her head, where hair would be on a human head.

                        Of course, Sophia's announcement was a calculated publicity stunt to generate headlines and keep Saudi Arabia forefront in your minds when you think about innovation, especially its commitment to a post-oil era. Through a mix of tourism, tech, and infrastructure, non-oil revenue is predicted to grow from $43.4 billion to $266.6 billion annually.


                        But Sophia's announcement also raises a number of Bladerunner-esque questions. What does it mean to be a citizen? What rights does Sophia hold? Saudi Arabia has not elaborated on this so far -- perhaps it will create a 'personhood' option, as proposed by the EU committee in January, regarding the rights of robots.

                        <h2>An Inside Look at the UFC's Plan for Conor McGregor and the Lightweight Title</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>O he UFC held a press conference January 19, and it was a weird one.

                        The idea was to promote and discuss April's UFC 223 fight card in Brooklyn, New York. At one point, the promotion brought out interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson and challenger Khabib Nurmagomedov.

                        These press conferences tend to follow a routine. There's a video at the beginning hyping one or two key fights. UFC President Dana White comes out and yells at the crowd, asking how everyone's doing. They're doing quite fine, they shout back, and then White brings out the fighters involved in the top bouts. The media ask questions; the fighters give answers.

                        No. White said McGregor is still the lightweight champion.

                        So Ferguson and Nurmagomedov are fighting for the interim—not the real—UFC lightweight title?
