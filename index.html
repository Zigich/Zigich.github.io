                        <h2>An Inside Look at the UFC's Plan for Conor McGregor and the Lightweight Title</h2>
                    </header>
                    <p>O he UFC held a press conference January 19, and it was a weird one.

                        The idea was to promote and discuss April's UFC 223 fight card in Brooklyn, New York. At one point, the promotion brought out interim lightweight champion Tony Ferguson and challenger Khabib Nurmagomedov.

                        These press conferences tend to follow a routine. There's a video at the beginning hyping one or two key fights. UFC President Dana White comes out and yells at the crowd, asking how everyone's doing. They're doing quite fine, they shout back, and then White brings out the fighters involved in the top bouts. The media ask questions; the fighters give answers.

                        No. White said McGregor is still the lightweight champion.

                        So Ferguson and Nurmagomedov are fighting for the interim—not the real—UFC lightweight title?
